### Description

I'm using node_pcap library with Node.js and NowJS for data syncing.
It's just yet another project just for fun and to test interesting technologies

### Using

sudo node webserver.js (yes, it requires root privileges)

Edit team.js - it containg mac addresses and photos of users that you want to detect
